          Description
 
          The NEW command is the same as the EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL
          page 126. NEW can only be used from edit mode. But now
          CALL NEW can be called from program mode. As expected
          all values are reset and all defined characters become
          undefined. Any open files are closed. Characters 32 to 95
          are reset to their standard definitions. The TRACE and
          BREAK commands are canceled. The program is erased from
          memory.
