          PEEKV          subprogram                            PAGE  P4
          -------------------------------------------------------------
 
          Format         CALL PEEKV(address,numeric-variable-list[,...])
 
 
          Description
 
          The PEEKV command reads data from VDP into the variable(s)
          specified. It functions identical to the regular EXTENDED
          BASIC PEEK command page 143. Except it reads from VDP.
          The VDP address should not exceed 16384 in a TI with a 9918
          VDP chip, 9938 or 9958 VDP chips can go the full 32767.
           VDP addresses above 32767 must be converted to a negative
          number by subtracting 65536 from the desired address. Also
          whenever a value is peeked or poked to the screen a screen
          offset is present. 96 must be subtracted from or added to the
          value to correct it.
 
          Programs
 
          The program to the right will | >100 CALL PEEKV(767,B)
          read a byte from VDP and put  |
          it into variable B.           |
          This line will print it.      | >110 PRINT B-96
                                        |
          Address loop counter          | >100 FOR D=0 TO 16383
          PEEK Grom address value.      | >110 CALL PEEV(D,X)
          Convert to HEX                | >120 CALL HEX(A,H$,X,B$)
          Show address and value.       | >130 PRINT "Address:";H$,
                                        |  D:"VALUE:";B$,X
          Loop.                         | >140 NEXT D
                                        |
