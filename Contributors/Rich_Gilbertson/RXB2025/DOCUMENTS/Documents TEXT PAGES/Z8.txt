       JOYSTICK and SPRITE POSITION CONTROL with KEY built in FIRE button
       ----------------------------------------------------------------
       As normal XB JOYSTICK and SPRITE controls were seperate commands
       this slowed down response in XB games and utilities. The main 
       issue was these commands were not combined. RXB added two new
       commands to the arsenal but also added CALL KEY and also added
       a IF THEN into the mix. Thus CALL JOYMAP acts just like
       CALL JOYST + CALL KEY + CALL MOTION + CALL POSITION 
       IF FIRE THEN line number 

       EXAMPLE:
       CALL JOYMAP(key-unit,x-return,y-return,#sprite,row-index,
       col-index,dot-row,dot-column),key-return-variable) 
       GOTO line-number

       key-unit,x-return,y-return are like normal XB JOYST
       #sprite,row-index,column-index are like XB MOTION but dot based
       dot-row,dot-column are like LOCATE
       key-return-variable is just like XB KEY key varible
       GOTO line-number is like XB IF KEY THEN line-number

       The GOTO is not required nor is the key-return-variable as these 
       are optional depending on your needs.
