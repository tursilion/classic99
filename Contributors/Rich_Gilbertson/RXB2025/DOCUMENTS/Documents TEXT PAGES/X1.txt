          Description
 
          The XB DSR (Device Service Routine) allows access to the
          RXB title screen. The access will work only if the DSR is
          in the GPLDSR or LINK DSR. In other words, a DSR that
          acknowledges any type of DSR in RAM, ROM, GROM, GRAM,
          or VDP. Most DSR's only accept DSK or PIO. Others like the
          SAVE or LIST commands will only work with a program in the
          memory first. Still others like CALL LOAD("XB") must have the
          CALL INIT command used first.
           From EA option 5 you may type XB then enter, or from EA
          option 3 type XB then enter, then enter again. If the EA
          option 1 (edit), then 4 (print) type XB. From TI BASIC
          use OLD XB or DELETE "XB".
           Keep in mind that if it does not work, the problem is the
          DSR your using. Almost all DSR's today only acknowledge the
          ROM or RAM DSR's. As the XB DSR is in GROM/GRAM it seems a
          bit short sighted on the part of most programmers to use
          cut down versions of a DSR. Please discourage this as it is
          a disservice to us all.
