          Format         CALL CLEARPRINT
 
          Description
 
           The CLEARPRINT command is just like the CLEAR command, but
          it clears columns 3 to 28 that is the PRINT or DISPLAY area
          leaving columns 1 and 2 along with columns 31 and 32 as are.
          Use CLEARPRINT to take the place of CALL HCHAR loops.
          CLEARPRINT runs from ROM.
