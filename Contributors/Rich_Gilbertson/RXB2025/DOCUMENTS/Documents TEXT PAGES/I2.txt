          Format         CALL INVERSE(character-code[,...])
 
                         CALL INVERSE(ALL[,...])
 
          Description
 
          The INVERSE subprogram finds the character definition of the
          character-code and inverts all the bytes in the character
          definition. That means it just reverses the foreground and
          background. The ALL feature inverts characters 30 to 143
          thus not affecting characters 144 to 159 as this would
          destroy sprites.
 
          Programs
 
          The program to the right will | >100 CALL INVERSE(65)
          INVERSE all character-code (A)|
          in the character definition   |
          table in memory.              |
                                        |
          The program to the right will | >100 CALL INVERSE(ALL)
          INVERSE all character-codes   |
          from 30 to 143.               |
                                        |
          Line 100 will ask for a string| >100 INPUT A$
          of characters terminated by   |
          the ENTER key.                |
          Line 110 is a loop to counter.| >110 FOR L=1 TO LEN(A$)
          Line 120 singles each one of  | >120 C=ASC(SEG$(A$,L,1))
          the characters in A$.         |
          Line 130 INVERSEs each one.   | >130 CALL INVERSE(C)
          Line 140 completes the loop.  | >140 NEXT L
          Line 150 restarts the program.| >150 GOTO 100
          (Be sure and not enter any blank characters in this program)
