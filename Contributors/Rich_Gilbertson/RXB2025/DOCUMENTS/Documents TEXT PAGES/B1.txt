          Description
 
          The BASIC DSR (Device Service Routine) allows access to
          the TI BASIC . The access will work only if the DSR is the
          GPLDSR or LINK DSR. In other words, a DSR that acknowledges
          any type of DSR in RAM, ROM, GROM, GRAM, or VDP. Most DSR's
          only accept DSK or PIO. Others like the SAVE or LIST commands
          will only work with a program in the memory first. Still
          others like CALL LOAD("EA") must have the CALL INIT command
          used first.
           Keep in mind that if it does not work, the problem is the
          DSR your using. Almost all DSR's today only acknowledge the
          ROM or RAM DSR's. As the BASIC DSR is in GROM/GRAM it seems
          a bit short sighted on the part of most programmers to use
          cut down versions of a DSR. Please discourage this practice
          as it is a disservice to us all.
 
          Programs
 
          Will go to BASIC prompt       | >100 CALL XB("BASIC")
          This line asks for a string.  | >100 INPUT A$
          If string A$="BASIC" will go  | >110 DELETE A$
          will switch to BASIC.         |
          Will switch to BASIC.         | >CALL BASIC
          Lower case also works!        | >CALL EA("basic")
