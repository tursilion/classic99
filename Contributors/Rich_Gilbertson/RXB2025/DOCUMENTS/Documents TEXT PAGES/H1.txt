          Format         CALL HCHAR(row,column,character-code)
 
                         CALL HCHAR(row,column,character-code,
                         repetition[,...])
 
          Description
 
           See EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL page 188 for more data. The only
          syntax change to HCHAR is the auto-repeat function. Notice the 
          new auto-repeat must have the repetitions used or it gets row
          confused with repetitions. Also RXB HCHAR is now in ROM.

          Options
          CALL HCHAR is now written in Assembly so much faster is
          faster than normal XB, also as separate line numbers are
          needed to continue placing characters on screen.
