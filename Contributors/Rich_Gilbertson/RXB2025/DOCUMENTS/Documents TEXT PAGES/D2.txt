          Description
 
           The DIR command catalogs the disk drive indicated by the
          # which can be 1 to z or by path name. The path name may be
          up to 30 characters long. A numeric variable or number can
          be used for drives 1 to 9 or if higher then it is assumed
          that the numeric-variable or number is a ASCII value between
          30 to 255. This allows a catalog of a RAM-DISK designated by
          letters or control characters.
           RXB DIR can be used from program mode or command mode. Also
          DIR can catalog up to 32 drives in one command.
           The SPACE BAR will pause the catalog routine, then when the
          pressed again continues the catalog listing.
          ANY OTHER KEY WILL ABORT THE CATALOG. See CAT for more info.
