          Format         CALL RMOTION(#sprite-number[,...])
 
                         CALL RMOTION(ALL[,...])
 
          Description
 
          The RMOTION subprogram reverses the row-velocity and
          column-velocity as numbers from -127 to 127. This means that
          RMOTION simply reverses the direction of the sprite specified
          so it goes in the opposite direction it was going in.
          This also means RMOTION ignores 0 and -128, so you can use
          those to bypass RMOTION if you do not want RMOTION to change
          the sprite. The fastest and slowest sprite speeds are never
          affected by RMOTION. This feature adds more power to RMOTION.
          The ALL feature also allows all sprites on the screen to
          reverse all at once. ALL may also be called as many times as
          wanted in a single program line. RMOTION runs from ROM.
 
          Program
 
          RMOTION reverses the row-     | >100 CALL RMOTION(#1)
          velocity and the column-      |
          velocity in sprite-number 1.  |
                                        |
          This line reverses the motion | >100 CALL RMOTION(ALL)
          of all sprites.               |
                                        |
          Line 100 sets up a sprite.    | >100 CALL SPRITE(#1,33,2,96,1
                                        |  8,99,84)
          Line 110 waits for a number   | >110 IF RND<.8 THEN 110
          higher than .8 randomly.      |
          Line 120 reverses the motion  | >120 CALL RMOTION(#1)
          of the sprite.                |
          Continues the program.        | >130 GOTO 110
