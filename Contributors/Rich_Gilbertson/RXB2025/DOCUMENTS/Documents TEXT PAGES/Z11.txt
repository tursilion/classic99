       RXB FIXES TO XB REQUESTED BY USERS
       ----------------------------------------------------------------
        RXB has numerous fixes thru the years a few will be mentioned
       here as far back as 1983 when I bought my TI99/4A.
        Recently asked to fix RANDOMIZE SEED not working with the 
       CALL LINK in XB, so I added a line to reset RANDOM SEED upon
       use of the CALL LINK. Your welcome.
        RXB and XB had a issue with PRINT that worked fine in BASIC 
       and a fix was made to solve this very rare issue. You might 
       have seen it when edge characters were improperly shown.
        CALL FILES(0) never worked in BASIC or XB but does work in
       RXB now. This meant a update to SIZE routine too.
        Another XB bug was this example:
       10 PRINT 
       LIST
       ACCEPT A
        Now a error is produced unlike version 110 XB crashes. 
       RXB shows this instead * Only legal in a program *


       THANKS TO LEE STEWART 
       ----------------------------------------------------------------
       RXB 2022 has muliple routines now in Assembly to speed up these
       routines ALPHALOCK, CLEAR, CLEARPRINT, CHARSET, COLLIDE, INIT, 
       HCHAR, HEX, ISROFF, ISRON, VCHAR, HPUT, HGET, ROLLDOWN, 
       ROLLLEFT, ROLLDOWN, ROLLUP, SCROLLDOWN, SCROLLLEFT, SCROLLRIGHT,
       SCROLLUP, VPUT, VGET and the character loader all are Assembly 
       in ROM. Expect next version of RXB to have even more Assembly 
       for former GPL routines thanks to help from Lee Stewart. 
       Specifically CLEAR, HPUT, VPUT, HCHAR, VCHAR, SCROLL, ROLL and
       CLEARPRINT are all speedy due to be Assembly now instead of GPL.
       Most recent additional Assembly was added to speed up CHARPAT,
       CHAR, CHARSET, COINC, COLOR, DELSPRITE, DISTANCE, JOYST, KEY,
       LOCATE, MAGNIFY, MOTION, PATTERN, POSITION, and SPRITE.
