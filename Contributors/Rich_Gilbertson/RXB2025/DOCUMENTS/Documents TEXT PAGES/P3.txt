          Format         CALL PEEKG(address,numeric-variable-list[,...])
 
 
          Description
 
          The PEEKG command reads data from GROM into the variable(s)
          specified. It functions identical to the regular EXTENDED
          BASIC PEEK command page 143. Except it reads from GROM/GRAM.
          GROM or GRAM address above 32767 must be converted to a
          negative number by subtracting 65536 from the desired
          address. Use CALL HEX to do this.
 
          Programs
 
          The program to the right will | >100 CALL PEEKG(767,B)
          read a byte from GROM.        |
                                        |
           Address loop counter         | >100 FOR D=-32768 TO 32767
           PEEK Grom address value.     | >110 CALL PEEG(D,X)
           Convert to HEX               | >120 CALL HEX(A,H$,X,B$)
           Show address and value.      | >130 PRINT "Address:";H$,
                                        |  D:"VALUE:";B$,X
           Loop.                        | >140 NEXT D
                                        |
