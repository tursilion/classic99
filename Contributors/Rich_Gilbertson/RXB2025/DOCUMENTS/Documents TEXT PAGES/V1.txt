          Format         CALL VCHAR(row,column,character-code)
 
                         CALL VCHAR(row,column,character-code,
                         repetition[,...])
 
          Description
 
           See EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL page 188 for more data. The only
          syntax change to VCHAR is the auto-repeat function. Notice the 
          new auto-repeat must have the repetitions used or it gets row
          confused with repetitions. Also RXB HCHAR is now in ROM.
          
 
          Programs
 
          This line puts character 38 at| >100 CALL VCHAR(1,1,38,99,9,1
           row 1 column 1 for 99 times, |  ,87)
           then puts character code 87  |
           at row 9 column 1            |
                                        |
          Fills screen with characters. | >100 CALL VCHAR(1,1,32,768,1,
                                        |  1,65,768,1,1,97,768,1,1,30,
                                        |  768) :: GOTO 100
                                        |

          Options
          CALL VCHAR is now written in Assembly so much faster is
          faster than normal XB, also as separate line numbers are
          needed to continue placing characters on screen.
          See HCHAR, HPUT, VPUT, HGET and VGET.
