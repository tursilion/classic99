          Here is an example DV80 file you save with the name BATCH.
 
                        ! BATCH file for using 
                        NEW and CALL FILES and RUN. cr
                        cr
                        CALL XB("DSK1.A-PROGRAM",#) cr
                        ! The # is 0 to 15 (see FILES)
 
         The above DV80 file uses cr to mean Carriage Return. And # is
        for the number of files you wish open. A-PROGRAM is the name of
        the XB program that needs a certain number of files open.
