          Format         LIST
 
                         LIST "device name"

          Description
 
          The LIST command is the same as per Extended Basic Manual
          page 114. The LIST routine has been modified to allow the
          line length to be output to a device. The line length can 
          only be used if a device is specified. A colon (:) must 
          follow the line length. If not included in the LIST 
          command, the line length is set to the default of the 
          specified output device.
          The line length can range from 1 to 255. If the length
          specified is outside this range, a Bad Line Number Error is
          reported.
