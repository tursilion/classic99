                           REA is a new completely re-written Editor Assembler module. 
                         Any code not needed was removed, and this left room for many 
                         new features. TI BASIC support has been removed to add in the 
                         features like catalog a drive and set pathnames.

                      S SET PATH NAMES
                      Sets path of Editor, Assembler,source, object, and list files.
                      Selection of 1 to 6 allows a input like as in previous Editor
                      Assembler version including REA. Selection of CTRL 1 to 5 will
                      allow single selection of drive number for that path. As an
                      example is select CTRL 1 and the number 1 in path DSK1.EDIT1 
                      will beep and ask for a drive number or letter. Another beep
                      indicates selection made and shows the change.
                                                      E EDITOR
                      Has a arrow to indicate which option has been selected, thus
                      the user will no longer make a mistake of saving a blank file
                      over the original that he actually meant to load or save. Also
                      as Edit path is preset the loading is automatic for the Editor
                      and the file to load. Save file still asks for a path name and
                      file. Print also asks for device or path name. 
                      i.e. DSK.VOLUMENAME.EDIT1 or WDS1.DIRECTORY.SUBDIRECTORY.EDIT1                       The directory will load the selected file if this option is
                      used. See Directory for features.
                    
                      A ASSEMBLER
                      Assembler has no menu selection as CONFIGURE PATHS does this.
                      The ASSM1 path from S SET PATH automatically loads Source,
                      Object, List file paths and Options. A Assember key press from
                      main menu starts the Assembler, but SET PATH must be first.
                      i.e. DSK.VOLUMENAME.ASSM1 or WDS1.DIRECTORY.SUBDIRECTORY.ASSM1
                       The directory will replace the selected file if this option
                      is used. See Directory for features.

                      L LOAD and RUN
                      The directory will load the selected file if this option is
                      used. After loading a file all the link names will be displayed
                      inclucding all support routines. Using arrow keys the selected
                      link name can be executed by pressing ENTER key. Up to 80 link
                      names will be displayed on screen thus arrow keys to select a
                      program name to run. See Directory for features.

                      P PROGRAM FILE
                      By pressing a single key then enter, DSK#.UTIL1 is displayed
                      and executed. # indicates the key pressed A to Z or 1 to 9.
                      Pressing 0 (zero) runs WDS1.UTIL1 at PROGRAM FILE. The directory
                      will load the selected file if this option is used. The lower 8K
                      support routines normally only loaded by the EA3 option are now
                      loaded by this option too. So users can load FORTH, FORTRAM, and
                      C programs from the EA5 prompt.
                      X XB PROGRAM
                      New feature that prompts for a XB program file to run. If the
                      file or device errors out, then a return to RXB command mode is
                      done. The * R X B * and a flashing cursor indicates the XB
                      command mode. By pressing a single key then enter, DSK#.LOAD is
                      displayed and executed. # indicates the key pressed. The
                      directory will load the selected file if this option is used.
                      See Directory for new features.

                      D DIRECTORY
                      A new feature that prompts for a device name. EXAMPLE: DSK1.
                      The period MUST be included if the full device name is used.
                      Or type in a path name EXAMPLE: WDS1.DIRECTORY. The quicker way
                      is to just type a number or letter then enter. Thus DSK#. is
                      used and the key pressed represents the # used. While the
                      catalog is being scrolled on screen, ANY KEY will pause the
                      display and reading of a disk, an arrow will appear next to the
                      file read and the ARROW KEYS will move the arrow up or down.
                      (FCNT/CTRL optional). To page forward or backward a screen at
                      a time press left and right arrow keys. The arrow last pointing
                      to will stay at the top or bottom of the screen display. This
                      in much better than other paging methods like DM1000 or Funnel
                      Web Disk review to see single lines.
 
                      ONLY the SPACE BAR will pause the catalog until pressed again.

                      2015 added new keys to Directory: 1 = Editor.                                                   A or a = Assembler file.
                                                   G or g = GPL Assembler file.

                      Use ENTER to select the filename so it will be placed into into
                      a buffer, the cataloger will auto-load Dis/Fix 80 files into
                      the EA3 menu, Programs will be EA5, and only Dis/Var 254 is
                      considered to be XB programs. So to load XB programs use the
                      SPACE BAR to buffer the filename, thus loading is automatic
                      from there for XB programs. For DIS/VAR 80 or DIS/FIX 80 files
                      to be edited or assembled use ENTER or SPACE BAR, then select
                      the Edit or Assembler from the main menu. Loading is automatic
                      from there.
                      Directory will automatically assume you wish to catalog a
                      sub-directory if a Directory was selected. To buffer anything
                      else you must use the SPACE BAR, to select a filename to be
                      placed into a buffer, then auto return to REA main menu. Now
                      select the option to be used from this buffer.

                      If you select D DIRECTORY again, the buffer will be used and the
                      last device accessed will be used again. If you wish to clear
                      the buffer just use FCTN BACK to the REA main menu.

                      NOTE:
                      SOURCE file name must be filled in as this is the default. But
                      if you use DIRECTORY to flag a file it will be placed into
                      S SET PATH NAMES for all uses.

                      . R X B
                      A previous feature that was optional since version 1000 but had
                      no menu option on screen indicating it was a option. (Period) .
                      will return to RXB menu screen.











                                                                            PAGE REA5

                      SYSTEM SUPPORT
                      The modified version of the Editor/Assembler no longer supports
                      the 99/4 computer. A 99/4A is required. All TI BASIC support
                      routines (CALL INIT, CALL LINK, CALL LOAD,CALL PEEK, CALL PEEKV,
                      CALL POKEV, and CALL CHARPAT) have been removed from the
                      Editor/Assembler. If you have a program that must be run from
                      TI BASIC and requires these routines, you must plug an
                      Editor/Assembler module into the cartridge connector.                      There are some assembly language programs that access data
                      internal to the Editor/Assembler cartridge. These programs
                      will not run correctly due to the re-structuring of the data
                      in the Editor/Assembler module. For these programs you must
                      use your Editor/Assembler cartridge. On the other hand like
                      FunnelWeb REA loads the support routines before EA3 or EA5
                      loaders to engage, so C, FORTRAM, and FORTH will load from
                      the EA5 prompt.

                      NO 32K NEEDED TO WHAT?                      REA has been totally re-written so the user can now use some
                      of the features of REA without that nasty *NO MEMORY EXPANSION*
                      error turning up. The error routine only disallows the user
                      from accessing those aspects of REA that absolutely needs 32K
                      to work. The user may now use the REA EDITOR PRINT FILE menu,
                      or use the x R X B file loader menu, or use D DIRECTORY menu.                      That means with RXB and REA the user can now print files, view
                      files, load any BASIC or XB program and catalog from REA with
                      or without a 32K memory.
                      EASTER EGGS
                      When on main menu of REA 2015 using keys 1 will still go to
                      the Editor, 2 will still go to Assembler, 3 will still go to
                      the Load and Run, and 5 will still go to RUN PROGRAM FILE.
                      There are more to look for.
