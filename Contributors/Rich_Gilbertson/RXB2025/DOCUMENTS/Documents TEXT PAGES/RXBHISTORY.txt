                          HISTORY OF RXB

 You can print out the manuals with any print file utility. Or just use
the option PRINT FILE of REA. Files are not TI Writer Formatted files.
 
 Version 1001 has a new subprogram called FILES and is like FILES of the
Disk Controller but does a NEW before returning to XB edit mode. CALL XBPGM 
now allows a comma then the number of files open. Version 1003 recieved a 
RXB program called LOADER that creates RXB LOAD programs and will run EA3, 
EA5, or XB and BASIC programs. USER is fixed so large size XB programs are 
now allowed, previously only 2k programs worked. Any size is ok now.
 
 Version 1004 has added CALL CHARSETALL for reseting character definitions 
32 to 127. The ALL option has been added to CHAR, COLOR  and MOTION so that 
many new graphics effects can be done. Some commands are now auto-repeating 
such as GCHAR, HCHAR, VCHAR, LDIAG, and RDIAG. Lastly CAT will now accept 
strings or numbers or even ASCII numbers. This one is almost smart, and 
will allow up to 32 drives to be cataloged in one command.
 
 Version 1005 fixed the CALL INIT as pointed out by Harry Wilhelm, he 
informed me that the CALL KEY needed repair, so a GENEVE now has ROMs 
for the BREAK KEY.
 
 Version 1006 has added CALL POKER for changing all 7 VDP Registers. 
( 9918 ) The AMS memory card is now supported with command CALLs like 
AMSMAP, AMSPASS, AMSON, and AMSOFF. Also to handle interupts are CALLs 
ISRON and ISROFF. PAUL SCHIPPNICK wrote the routines in assembly for 
the AMS, I then used them differently to make RXB versions. Thanks Paul. 
For RXB assembly support are CALLs AMSINIT which sets up the AMS for MAP 
mode, and AMSBANK that will switch 4K banks in the lower and upper half 
of the 8K assembly area.
 
 Version 1007 has added BLOAD and BSAVE (binary load and save) for the 
lower 8K to replace the slow speed of CALL LOAD and is more flexable 
then hidden loaders. The KEY subprogram has a new feature of only 
responding to string of keys. Files GENEVE and GENEVE1 are ROM 
replacements for the GENEVE version of RXB, so if you have a GENEVE use 
these ROMs instead to get a FCTN 4 (Break key).
 
 Version 1008 has added BASIC device so at a device prompt XB, EA , and 
BASIC all go to that module. The RXB title screen has an added feature 
of DSK#.BATCH which runs DV80 control files. SIZE has been fixed to 
report proper errors. SIZE now reports the number of K the AMS has and 
the number of AMS BANKS available for lower 8K switching thru the 
subprogram AMSBANK.
 
 Version 1009 has added hard drive and floppy support routines. PROTECT 
for unprotection or protection of files. RENAME to rename files or 
directorys. FCOPY to copy files from drive to drive. MKDIR to create 
directorys on hard drives or name disks. RMDIR to delete directorys 
from hard drives. And for The Western Horizon SCSI controller there is 
SCSI that gets the hard drive information from the drive itself. 
The SCSI string contains vendor hard drive ID, name, type, version, 
size of sectors, and number of sectors. CAT will catalog hard drives 
now and report directorys.
 
 Version 1010 has code clean up and new RXB programs. LOADER creates 
a single LOAD program that can load 578 files. RXBDM is a disk/hard 
manager that works with any type of DISK or HARD drive controller or 
RAMDISK.
 
 Version 1011 to 1015 received updates and the new command CUTDIR  
which deletes directorys as RMDIR and also deletes all sub-directorys.
 
 Version 2000 was to be the last update to RXB. It included document 
updates and the new command SECTOR that can read up to 32 sectors into 
the lower 8K.
 
 Version 2001 is now the last update to RXB when I found some errors in 
2000 and felt the need to repair them. So documents and files have been 
rewritten. SECTOR now works with TI, CorComp, Myarc, PARCOM and SCSI 
disk controllers.

 Version 2002 added pressing 0 (ZERO) at title screen runs WSD1.LOAD from
hard drive root directory. SIZE now reports the memory and pages used by
AMS memory. 

 Version 2011 added ONKEY & GOTO for key input with a GOTO. Updated REA
as a standalone package and included package with RXB also.

 Version 2012 was a total rewrite of RXB source GPL code to pour over all
bugs that could be found and fixed. All RXB document rewritten and all the 
program examples tested thoroughly. Updated XB example programs and added 
many more. Release date to be before end of world 2012. (Joke)
 
RXB was created in 1989 and has been my (mostly) sole project for over 20 years.
