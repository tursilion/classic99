          Description

           The RND subprogram in RXB has been replaced with a TI BASIC
          version as the normal XB RND subprogram is hindered with so
          much Floating Point as to make it 3 times slower then the 
          TI BASIC version of RND. Extensive testing proves that the
          new RXB RND is many times faster then the previous version.
           There will actually be some programs expecting a particular
          RND pattern of random numbers that will no longer work the 
          same as a result of this change. But games will appear more
          random then normal Extended Basic.
           The RANDOMIZE seed still works but the results of the that
          pattern of random numbers will be different then normal XB,
          thus unless absolutely required will be a bigger benefit 
          then the cost of this XB previous feature.

          Program
      
          RND example to prove speed    | >100 DIM N(100)
          Counter in a FOR loop         | >110 FOR X=1 TO 100
          Load Array with random numbers| >120 N(X)=RND
          Show that number              | >130 PRINT N(X)
          Repeat loop till done         | >140 NEXT X
           
          Run this above example in TI BASIC, XB and RXB 2015 to
          show game type results of program results with new RND
          

          Options
          Random Music programs will sound very very fast.
