          Description
 
          See EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL PAGE 122 for more data. The only 
          reason for this page in RXB is a problem with SIZE and the
          MERGE command breaks SIZE from working as they both use the
          same address to record XB RAM END ADDRESS. This problem
          will only happen if you use PRAM to change program normal 
          start and end locations of XB RAM. Please never use the
          merge command if you have changed XB RAM with PRAM command.

 
          Command
 
          Change locations to start XB  | >CALL PRAM(-12288,-16384)
          to >C000 and end to >D000     | 
          This will load a program.     | >OLD DSK1.TEST
          This will merge both programs.| >MERGE DSK1.TEST2
          SIZE will report wrong program| >SIZE 
          space incorrectly             |
