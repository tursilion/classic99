          Format         CALL BIAS(numeric-variable,string-variable
                         [,...])
 
          Description
 
          The BIAS command adds 96 to all characters in the string or
          subtracts 96 from all characters in the string. If numeric
          variable is 0 then it subtracts the XB screen bias of 96
          from the characters, if the numeric variable is not 0 then
          it adds the XB screen bias of 96 to all the characters in
          the string. ONLY A STRING VARIABLE IS ALLOWED FOR BIAS.
           The XB screen bias only affects characters read or written
          to the screen. See PEEKV, POKEV and MOVES.
 
          Programs
 
          The program to the right will | >100 CALL MOVES("V$",255,511
          load X$ with 255 characters   |  ,X$)
          off the screen. But will not  |
          be readable due to a bias.    |
          The bias is now subtracted    | >110 CALL BIAS(0,X$)
          from the string printed.      | >120 PRINT X$
                                        |
          Set up a string to use        | >100 Y$="This is a test!"
          Remove add BIAS to string     | >110 CALL BIAS(1,Y$)
          Put the string onto screen    | >120 CALL MOVES("$V",15,Y$,
                                        |  96)
                                        |

          The above program copies 255 bytes from screen address 511
          (511=15 rows plus 31 columns) into string X$. Then BIAS      
          removes 96 from each byte in string X$. Finally X$ is 
          shown on screen by PRINT X$
