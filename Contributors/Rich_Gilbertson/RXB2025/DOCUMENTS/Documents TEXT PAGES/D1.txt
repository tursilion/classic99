          Format       DEL start line-end line
 
          Description
 
          The DEL command is used to delete a line or block of lines
          from a program. Start line number and end line number define
          the lines to be deleted. If start line number is omitted,
          line deletion will begin at the first line of the program. In
          this case, end line number must be preceded by a dash. If
          end line number is omitted, line deletion will end at the last
          line of the program. If start line number and end line number
          are omitted, then the first line number of the program to the
          last line number of the program is deleted. At least one valid
          program line must exist between start line number and end line
          number or a Bad Line Number Error will be reported. If only
          one line number is given without a dash, then that one line
          will be deleted.
           After the DEL command has executed any open files are closed
          and all variables are lost.
