          Format         CALL FILES(number)
 
                         CALL FILES(numeric-variable)

 

           If you use CALL FILES and SIZE:
          CALL FILES(15)  5624 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(14)  6142 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(13)  6660 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(12)  7178 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(11)  7696 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(10)  8214 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(9)   8732 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(8)   9250 Stack Bytes Free 
          CALL FILES(7)   9768 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(6)  10286 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(5)  10804 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(4)  11322 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(3)  11840 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(2)  12358 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(1)  12876 Stack Bytes Free
          CALL FILES(0)  13394 Stack Bytes Free  

          This shows the free VDP memory for XB programs and how it
          is calculated is first free addres in high VDP memory 
          minus VDP Stack Address plus 64 bytes in lower VDP memory.

          You should notice each CALL FILES is 518 bytes in size.

          Lastly RXB created CALL FILES(0) and is not the same as
          any other CALL FILES(0) by others as RXB follows TI
          standards to be consistant and predictable.
