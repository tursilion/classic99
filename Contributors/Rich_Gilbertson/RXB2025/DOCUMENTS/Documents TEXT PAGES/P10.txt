          Format         CALL PRAM(start-RAM-address,end-RAM-address)

          Description
 
          The PRAM command changes the location of the Start and End 
          of XB RAM program space. Normally XB RAM is start address 
          is >FFE7 and end address is >A040 in hex so the PRAM command
          allows changing this location to as low as 1 byte of XB RAM 
          PROGRAM SPACE.
          Any location from >A000 to >FFFF is a valid change in PRAM.
          This command has no effect on Lower 8K Assembly RAM.
          Use of PRAM is for control of XB RAM space and XB programs 
          can reside anywhere in the upper 24K RAM locations. Combined
          with PSAVE and PLOAD assembly can be utilized in upper 24K.
