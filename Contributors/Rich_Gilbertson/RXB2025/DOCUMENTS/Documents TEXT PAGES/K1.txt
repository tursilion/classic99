          Description
 
          See EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL page 109
          RXB has added auto repeat features.
           Strings or string variables can now be added to KEY to lock
          out any other keys. The strings can be empty or up to 255 in
          length. The string function halts program execution unlike a
          normal key routine similar to ACCEPT or INPUT do.
