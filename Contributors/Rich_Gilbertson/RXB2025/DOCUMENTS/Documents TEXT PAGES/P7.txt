          Format         CALL POKEG(address,numeric-variable-list[,...])
 
 
          Description
 
          The POKEG command writes the data in the numeric variable
          list to GRAM at the specified address. It functions identical
          to the EXTENDED BASIC command LOAD page 115. Except that it
          writes to GRAM. GROM or GRAM addresses above 32767 must be
          converted to a negative number by subtracting 65536 from the
          desired address. CALL HEX is recommended for this.
