                         CALL CHAR(ALL,pattern-identifier[,...])

          characters 30 to 159 by redefined, but this affects sprites. 
          Now 30 (CURSOR) and 31 (EDGE CHARACTER) to be redefined. 
          Also 144 to 159 may be redefined if sprites are not used.
          Pattern-identifier increased from 64 to 240 string. Thus up
          to 15 characters may be defined in single command, 4 was old
          limit in XB allowed to be defined in XB manaual page 56
          CHAR runs from ROM.
