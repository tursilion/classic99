          SAMS           subprogram                            PAGE  S2
          -------------------------------------------------------------
 
          Example is mixing commands:
          100 CALL SAMS("ON","MAP",2,237,"OFF")
          This turns on SAMS read/write Registers, turns on MAP mode, 
          sets 4K page with page 237 than turns off SAMS read/write 
          Registers. 


          Programs
 
          This turns on the SAMS mapper.| >110 CALL SAMS("ON")
          This reads low half 8K page.  | >120 CALL PEEK(16388,L)
          This reads high half 8K page. | >130 CALL PEEK(16390,H)
          This shows pages used.        | >140 PRINT "LOW";L;"HIGH";H
          This loads a assembly program.| >150 CALL LOAD("DSK1.CHAR")
          This changes low/high 4K pages| >160 CALL SAMS(2,16,3,17)
          This loads a assembly program.| >170 CALL LOAD("DSK1.DUMP")
          This changes low/high back.   | >180 CALL SAMS(2,L,3,H)
          This uses a routine in CHAR.  | >190 CALL LINK("CHAR")
          This changes low/high again.  | >200 CALL SAMS(2,16,3,17)
          This uses a routine in DUMP.  | >210 CALL LINK("DUMP")
                                        |
           The above example program shows one RXB program using two
          assembly programs with links for both. Thus only 16K of the
          SAMS was used. 1024K would be 120 assembly support programs
          Compatibility of most software assured in RXB AMS support.

          Options:
          See ON, OFF, MAP and PASS pages in RXB Documents for more 
          information on SAMS.
