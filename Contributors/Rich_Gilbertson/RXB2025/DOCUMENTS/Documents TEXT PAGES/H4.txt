          Format         CALL HGET(row,column,length,string-variable
                         [,...])
 
          Description
 
          The HGET subprogram returns into a string-variable from the
          screen at row and column. Length determines how many
          characters to put into the string-variable. Row numbers from
          1 to 24 and column numbers from 1 to 32. Length may number
          from 1 to 255. If HGET comes to the edge of the screen then
          it wraps to the other side. HGET runs from ROM.
