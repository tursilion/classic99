          PLOAD             subprogram                         PAGE  P6
          -------------------------------------------------------------

          PLOAD is faster then CALL LOAD as it loads Program Image vs
          LOAD which is stuck with slow uncompressed DF 80 files.

          SAMS users will find this a easy way to load RXB AMS support
          into lower 8K.
          EXAMPLE:
                  >100 Z$="DSK1.PAGE" 
                  >110 FOR L=0 TO 15 STEP 2
                  >120 CALL SAMS(2,L,3,L+1)
                  >130 CALL PLOAD(2,Z$&STR$(L),3,Z$&STR(L+1))
                  >140 NEXT L
                  >150 CALL XB("DSK1.MAINPROGRAM",1) 
      
           The above program would load RXB SAMS pages 0 to 15 into
           SAMS memory from files named PAGE0 to PAGE15 on disk 1. 
           Then would set CALL FILES 1 and RUN "DSK1.MAINPROGRAM" 
           with 64K of Assembly support for RXB. (16x4K=64K)
