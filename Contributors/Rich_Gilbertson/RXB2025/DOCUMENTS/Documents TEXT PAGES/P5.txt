          PLOAD          subprogram                            PAGE  P5

          Format         CALL PLOAD(memory-boundry,"access-name")
 
                         CALL PLOAD(contant,string-variable)
 
          Description
 
          The PLOAD subprogram loads ONLY program image files created
          by PSAVE. PLOAD is the opposite of PSAVE. PLOAD is a faster
          version of CALL LOAD. PLOAD has the speed of a hidden loader
          and is much easier to use. PLOAD loads any 4K boundry in 32K.
           Memory boundries are 2, 3, A, B, C, D, E, F (upper case).
          i.e. 2 is >2000 or 3 is >3000 or A is >A000 up to F is >F000
          Removing the zeros made more sense then adding 3 zeros.
           Unlike CALL LOAD the PLOAD and PSAVE subprogram will work
          without CALL INIT being used first. Remember to turn on the
          interrupts if the program has them. Or the program support
          will not work. See ISROFF and ISRON.
          NOTE: 4K of VDP memory MUST be free for PLOAD to function or
                a memory full error will result. Always place the
                PLOAD command at the top of the RXB program.
