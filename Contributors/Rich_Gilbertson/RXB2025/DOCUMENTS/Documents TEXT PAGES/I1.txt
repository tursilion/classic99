          INIT           subprogram                            PAGE  I1

          Format         CALL INIT
 
 
          Description
 
          The INIT command is the same as the EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL
          page 101. Originally INIT loaded more data then actually
          existed, this has been fixed. The other correction is that
          you no longer have to use INIT before LINK, or LOAD. They
          will function if INIT has been called first or not. Unless
          loading a program that needs the INIT first.

          * NOTE *
          RXB only loads up to >24F4 first open byte. Reasons 
          unknown XB loads useless junk from >24EA to >25FF that
          seems to be a programming error loading 277 useless
          bytes. Thus normal XB over writes these 277 bytes.
