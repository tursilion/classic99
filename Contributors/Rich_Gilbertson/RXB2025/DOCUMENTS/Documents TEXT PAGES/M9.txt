          Options
          Dependent on Assembly Language programmers and the RXB
          programs that are developed. MOVES is good for replacing those
          CALL LOAD loops. It also provides a means to rewrite XB while
          running XB instead of rewriting MERGE files then loading
          them. Future devices benefit from MOVES as it can copy or move
          different types of memory directly from or to them.
