                              SAMS MAPPER
     ******************************************************************
     The SAMS card has tons of documents as to its function and use.
     So to re-explain these docs would be pointless. Read the docs or
     find some, sorry but the RXB package is already huge.
     In PASS mode the mapper register setup is equivalent to:

      HEX     Dec            HEX  Dec            memory area
