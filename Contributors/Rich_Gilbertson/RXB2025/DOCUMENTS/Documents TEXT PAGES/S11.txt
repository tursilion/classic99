          Description
 
          See EXTENDED BASIC MANUAL PAGE 169 for more data. 
          RXB has added many more features to SIZE. RXB shows the
          size and memory address of VDP, RAM and SAMS. Very uselful
          for XB or Assembly progammers. EXAMPLE:
 
          >SIZE                          
             11840 Bytes of Stack Free 
             24488 Bytes of Program    
             8192  Bytes of Assembly   
             * PAGE NUMBER = LOCATION *
             2     Page = >2000 - >2FFF
             3     Page = >3000 - >3FFF
             10    Page = >A000 - >AFFF                                                                                                                                                                    
             11    Page = >B000 - >BFFF
             12    Page = >C000 - >CFFF
             13    Page = >D000 - >DFFF
             14    Page = >E000 - >EFFF
             15    Page = >F000 - >FFFF
             * MEMORY UNUSED and FREE *
             >37D7 VDP Free Address    
             >0958 VDP STACK Address   
             >FFE7 Program Free Address
             >A040 Program End Address 
             >2000 RAM Free Address    
             >4000 RAM End Address 
 
            This shows normal XB values but also includes more
           useful things like Assembly free and SAMS pages 
           used and where these pages are. Lastly it shows
           VDP STACK location, First free VDP address, XB RAM
           First free address and End address. Lastly first
           free Assembly address and End address used. SAMS size is
           not reported just like Foppy size or hard drive is'nt!
