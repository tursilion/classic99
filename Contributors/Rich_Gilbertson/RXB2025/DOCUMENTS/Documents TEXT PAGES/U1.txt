          USER           subprogram                            PAGE  U1

          Format         CALL USER(quoted-string)
 
                         CALL USER(string-variable)
 
          Description
 
          The USER subprogram overrides the normal editor of edit mode
          of XB and reads a DV80 file into the key scan routine as if
          the user was keying it in.
           That means Batch Processing is creating XB programs from
          DV80 files, Editing XB programs, MERGING, Saving, and
          RUNNING XB programs. Also RESequencing, adding lines, or
          deleting lines, and re-writing lines from the DV80 file.
           Every line to be input from the DV80 file MUST END WITH A
          CARRIAGE RETURN! A line of input may be up to 588 characters
          in length. The editor will error out if the crunch buffer is
          full, reporting a *Line Too Long* error. (Over 163 tokens)
           Other errors will be reported but will not stop the process
          of USER continuing to input lines. To find errors in the DV80
          file the input lines are shown on screen as they are input
          into the editor, and errors will be reported. So you must
          observe the screen for errors to test the DV80 file.
           USER will stop after reaching the end of the file. But USER
          can have its operation suspended CALL POKEV(2242,0) will
          halt USER and CALL POKEV(2242,9) will resume USER.
           INPUT and ACCEPT will try to read from USER if it is not
          turned off. On the other hand DV80 files can go directly into
          a INPUT or ACCEPT prompts. Turn off USER to be safe though.
           USER will only report errors upon opening, thus if incorrect
          device or filename then USER reports * USER ERROR * and just
          closes the USER file, thus ending operation of USER.
           Example files are included with RXB to show and explain the
          use of USER. The batch processing USER subprogram opens a new
          world to the RXB programmer. 
          Addtionally new commands like CALL VDPSTACK and CALL PRAM used
          with CALL USER means you can modify the entire XB memory in 
          both VDP and RAM from a BATCH file.
          Possibilities are almost endless!
