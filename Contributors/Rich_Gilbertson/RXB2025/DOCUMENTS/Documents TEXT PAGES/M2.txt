          MAP (SAMS)     option for subprogram                 PAGE  M2
          -------------------------------------------------------------
 
          Format         CALL SAMS("MAP"[,...])
 
 
          Description
 
          The SAMS MAP command will only work with a AMS memory card. 
          MAP MODE on the AMS card means the mapper registers are
          turned on so they can be changed. But even with the mapper on
          unless the read/write lines are on no mappers will appear to
          be at the DSR address. SAMS ON turns on read/write mapper 
          registers.
          Then a LOAD or SAMS can change the memory pages.
          See docs MANUAL-SAMS for examples of memory maps. Also run
          SAMS-TEST or SAMS-SAVE or SAMS-LOAD programs.
 
          Programs
 
          This turns on map mode.       | >100 CALL SAMS("MAP")
          This turns on read/write.     | >110 CALL SAMS("ON")
          This fetches map register 2.  | >120 CALL PEEK(16388,BYTE)
          This turns off read/write.    | >130 CALL SAMS("OFF")
          This turns on pass mode.      | >140 CALL SAMS("PASS")
          This prints the page from map | >150 PRINT "Register 2 PAGE#"
           mode in register 2.          |  ;BYTE
                                        |

          The above program will print out whatever SAMS page is
          presently stored in SAMS map register 2.


          It is recommended that CALL SAMS("MAP") only be used to 
          check SAMS pages with CALL PEEK. CALL SAMS is much more easy
          to use to manage AMS memory.
