          Description
 
           The CAT command catalogs the disk drive indicated by the
          # which can be 1 to z or by path name. The path name may be
          up to 30 characters long. A numeric variable or number can
          be used for drives 1 to 9 or if higher then it is assumed
          that the numeric-variable or number is a ASCII value between
          30 to 255. This allows a catalog of a RAM-DISK designated by
          letters or control characters. Also CAT can catalog up to 32 
          drives in one command. The SPACE BAR will pause the catalog 
          routine, then when the pressed again continues the catalog 
          listing. ANY OTHER KEY WILL ABORT THE CATALOG.
