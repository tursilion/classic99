          EXECUTE does no checking so the address must be correct. 
          The LINK method finds the name and uses the 2 byte address 
          after the name to run the Assembly. EXECUTE just runs the 
          address without looking for a name thus faster.

          Options.
          Dependent on Programmers use and skill.
