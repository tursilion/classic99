          Format         CALL PSAVE(memory-boundry,"access-name")
 
                         CALL PSAVE(constant,string-variable)
 
          Description
 
          The PSAVE subprogram saves ONLY program image files to be
          used for PLOAD. PSAVE is the opposite of PLOAD. PSAVE has
          the speed of a hidden loader without the hassle. 
          PLOAD saves any 4K boundry from 32K.
           Memory boundries are 2, 3, A, B, C, D, E, F (upper case).
          i.e. 2 is >2000 or 3 is >3000 or A is >A000 up to F is >F000
          Removing the zeros made more sense then adding 3 zeros.
           Unlike CALL LOAD the PLOAD and PSAVE subprogram will work
          without CALL INIT being used first.
           To save a program with hidden loaders just break program
          after loading is complete and type:
          CALL PSAVE(2,"DSK#.NAME1",3,"DSK#.NAME2") ! 2 4K of lower 8K
          Remember to check for interrupts or the program will not work
          after loading with PLOAD. See ISRON and ISROFF.
          NOTE: 4K of VDP memory MUST be free for PSAVE to function or
                a memory full error will result. Always place the PSAVE
                command at the top of the RXB program.
