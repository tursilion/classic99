          Format         CALL CHARSET

                         CALL CHARSET(ALL)
 
          Description
 
           The CHARSET command is just like the CHARSET command, but
          it resets characters from 30 to 127. CHARSET thus resets 32 
          to characters to 95 only. Exactly like CHARSET it also resets 
          colors to original mode. CALL CHARSET(ALL) resets all the 
          characters from 30 to 159 and all colors to original. This
          is same as you would expect from TI Basic or RXB when not 
          using SPRITES, or just the first few SPRITES. CHARSET runs 
          from ROM.
