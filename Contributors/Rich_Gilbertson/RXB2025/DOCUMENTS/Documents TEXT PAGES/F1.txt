                         CALL FILES(numeric-variable)
 
          Description
 
          The FILES subprogram differs from the Disk Controller FILES
          on the CorComp, TI, Myarc or Parcom versions. All of these
          require a NEW after CALL FILES. NEW is executed after the
          FILES subprogram in RXB, so there is no need to use NEW.
          Also RXB FILES accepts values from 0 to 15 unlike the other
          FILES routines that can only accept 0 to 9. Each open file
          reduces VDP by 534 bytes, plus each file opened will use
          518 bytes more. Only RXB has a valid CALL FILES(0) or a
          CALL FILES(15) that works.
 
          Programs
 
          FILES opens usual buffers.    | >CALL FILES(3)
                                        |
          FILES ends the program and    | >100 CALL FILES(1)
          executes NEW.                 |
                                        | 
          Only possible in RXB          | >100 CALL FILES(15)
                                        | >SIZE
                                        |
          Only possible in RXB          | >CALL FILES(0)
                                        | >SIZE
                                        |
                                        

          Will display 5624 Bytes of Stack free and 24488 Bytes of
          Program space free. At this point up to 15 files may be
          open at the same time. Not recommended but possible now.
          Also 0 files now is possible in RXB.

          Options
          See XB for even more powerful applications made easy.
          For example CALL XB("DSK1.LOAD",1)  will do a 
          CALL FILES(1) then NEW then RUN "DSK1.LOAD" AUTOMATICALLY
