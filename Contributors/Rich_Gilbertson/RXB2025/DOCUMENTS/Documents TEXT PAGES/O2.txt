          ON (SAMS)      option for subprogram                 PAGE  O2
          -------------------------------------------------------------
 
          Format         CALL SAMS("ON")
 
 
          Description
 
          SAMS("ON") command will only work with a SAMS memory card. 
          The read/write lines to the SAMS mapper registers are turned 
          on so they can be changed. Any PEEK or LOAD to the DSR space 
          can then be used to change the mapper registers or read them.
          See docs MANUAL-SAMS for examples of memory maps. Also run
          SAMS-TEST or SAMS-SAVE or SAMS-LOAD programs.
 
          Programs
 
          This turns on read/write.     | >100 CALL SAMS("ON")
          This loads 9 in map register 2| >110 CALL LOAD(16388,9)
          This turns off read/write.    | >120 CALL SAMS("OFF")
          This loads values in lower 8K.| >130 CALL LOAD(8192,1,2,3,4)
          This turns on pass mode.      | >140 CALL SAMS("PASS")
          This peeks values in lower 8K.| >150 CALL PEEK(8192,A,B,C,D)
          This prints values.           | >160 PRINT A;B;C;D
          This turns ON read/write & MAP| >170 CALL SAMS("ON","MAP")
          This loads 2 in map register 2| >180 CALL LOAD(16388,2)
          Turns off read/write & PASS   | >190 CALL SAMS("OFF","PASS")
          This peeks values in low page.| >200 CALL PEEK(8192,A,B,C,D)
          This prints values.           | >210 PRINT A;B;C;D
                                        |
 

          It is recommended to use CALL SAMS("ON") only for when a
          CALL PEEK is used to check a mapper register value.
          CALL SAMS manages AMS mapping much better.
