          Description
 
          The EA DSR (Device Service Routine) allows access to the
          Editor Assembler section of RXB. The access will work only
          if the DSR is the GPLDSR or LINK DSR. In other words, a DSR
          that acknowledges any type of DSR in RAM, ROM, GROM, GRAM,
          or VDP. Most DSR's only accept DSK or PIO. Others like the
          SAVE or LIST commands will only work with a program in the
          memory first. Still others like CALL LOAD("EA") must have 
          the CALL INIT command used first. Almost all DSR's today 
          only acknowledge the ROM or RAM DSR's. 
 
          Programs
 
          Go to the Editor Assembler.   | >100 CALL XB("EA")
                                        |
          This line asks for a string.  | >100 INPUT A$ :: DELETE A$
          Type EA will go to EA module  |
                                        |
          Switch to Editor Assembler    | >CALL CAT("EA")
                                        |
          Lower case can also be used.  | >call ea
                                        |
          Strange looping effect.       | >CALL EA("EA")
 
          Options
