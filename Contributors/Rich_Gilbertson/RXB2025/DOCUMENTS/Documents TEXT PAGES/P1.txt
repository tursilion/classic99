          Format         CALL SAMS("PASS")
 
 
          Description
 
          SAMS("PASS") command will only work with a SAMS memory card.
          PASS MODE on the SAMS card means the mapper registers are not
          on. This is the normal mode of the SAMS. No extra memory is
          is available or used. This renders the SAMS like a normal 32K
          card. See docs MANUAL-SAMS for examples of memory maps. Also
          run SAMS-TEST or SAMS-SAVE or SAMS-LOAD programs.

          SAMS("PASS") is mainly used to turn off SAMS or protect the 
          SAMS pages from being used or to behaves like a normal 32K
          when the SAMS is not being used.
