          Description
 
          The MOVE command is used to move a program line or block of
          program lines to another location in the program. The block
          of lines to be moved is defined by start line number and
          end line number. If either of these numbers are omitted, the
          defaults are the first program line and the last program line.
          However, at least one number and a dash must be entered (both
          cannot be omitted), and there must be at least one valid 
          program line between start line number and end line number. 
          To move one both the start line number and end line number 
          are the same. If any of the above conditions are not met, a 
          Bad Line Number Error will be reported. The new start line 
          number defines the new line number of the first line in the 
          moved segment. When the block is moved it will be moved. If 
          not, a Bad Line Number Error message is reported. This 
          problem can be corrected by using a smaller increment, or
          by using RES to open up space for the segment. A Bad Line
          Number Error also results if the renumbering process would
          result in a line number higher than 32767. Although moving 
          lines within the program does not increase the size of the  
          program, this command does require 4 bytes of the program 
          space for line moved. This memory use is temporary, but it 
          must be available in order to move the block. If sufficient
          memory is not available a Memory Full Error results and no
          lines are moved. This problem can usually be worked around 
          by moving the block a few lines at a time.Before the block 
          of lines is moved any open files are closed and any 
          variables are lost.
