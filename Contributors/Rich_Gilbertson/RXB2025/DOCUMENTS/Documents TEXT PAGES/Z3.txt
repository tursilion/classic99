       BATCH FILE SYSTEM:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       CALL USER overrides the normal edit mode by allowing a DV80 file
       to take control. This allows conversions from DV80 to XB program
       or DV80 to XB MERGE format or loading files, re-sequencing them,
       and saving or merging or adding lines through another DV80 file.
       All variables used through CALL USER are not affected so from a
       running program more lines or variables can be added to the size
       of the program without losing anything. Of course the RUN command
       will as always clear all variables before the program is run,
       this feature can be turned off with a CALL LOAD. (PRESCAN OFF)
        As the USER subprogram can override the Editor many features can
       be bypassed. Example:
                            NEW                       cr
                            OLD DSK1.XBPROGRAM        cr
                            RES 11,3                  cr
                            MERGE "DSK1.MERGEPGM"     cr
                            SIZE                      cr
                            SAVE "DSK1.NEWPROGRAM"    cr
                            RUN                       cr
                            NEW                       cr  
                            OLD DSK1.LOAD             cr  
 
        The above is a good example of a DV80 Batch file for RXB. Note
       that there must be a CHR$(13) or Carriage Return after every input
       line. If not then RXB assumes the it is the same line. But even
       that is not much of a problem as RXB allows 21 lines of input per
       program line. You can make them even longer if you want in USER.
