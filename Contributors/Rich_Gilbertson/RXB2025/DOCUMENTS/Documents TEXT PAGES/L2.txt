          Format         CALL LOAD(address,value[,...])

                         CALL LOAD("access-name"[,...])
 
          Description
 
          The LOAD subprogram is used along with INIT, LINK, and PEEK,
          to access assembly language subprograms. The LOAD subprogram
          loads an assembly language object file or direct data into 
          the Memory Expansion for later execution using the LINK 
          statement.

          The LOAD subprogram can specify one or more files from which
          to load object data or lists of direct load data, which
          consists of an address followed by data bytes. The address 
          and data bytes are seperated by commas. Direct load data 
          must be seperated by file-field, which is a string expression
          specifing a file from which to load assembly language object 
          code. File-field may be a null string when it is used merely
          to seperate direct load data fields. Use of LOAD subprogram 
          wth incorrect values can cause the computer to cease to 
          fuction and require turning it off and back on. 

          Assembly language subprogram names (see LINK) are included 
          in the file. 
          
          RXB does not check for Memory Expansion if address, values are 
          loaded. EXAMPLE: CALL LOAD(-32000,15) {-32000 = >8300 hex}
          This was a oversight by original XB teams. This change
          allows a poke into memory with or without Memory Expansion.
          If Object Code File is loaded a CALL INIT is still checked.
