                         RANDOMIZE SEED


          Description

           The RANDOMIZE command can be found on XB manual page 151 to
          help explain it's use. RXB unlike any other XB produced has 
          a feature that makes RND and RANDOMZE different and better.
          RANDOMIZE SEED in RXB is same as TI BASIC randomize seed.
          Thus in RXB do not expect the same random numbers as you 
          would get with any other XB made. RXB is way more random
          due to this change different then any other Extended Basic.

          Program
      
          Will put hex >3567 into seed  | >100 RANDOMIZE
          RND example to prove speed    | >110 DIM N(100)
          Counter in a FOR loop         | >120 FOR X=1 TO 100
          Load Array with random numbers| >130 N(X)=RND
          Show that number              | >140 PRINT N(X)
          Repeat loop till done         | >150 NEXT X
           
          Run this above example in TI BASIC, XB and RXB 2020 to
          show game type results of program results with new RND
          

          Options
          Random Music programs will sound very very fast due to
          the speed increase in RXB RND is much faster.
