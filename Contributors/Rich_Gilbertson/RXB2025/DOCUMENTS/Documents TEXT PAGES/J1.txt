          subprogram. It creates two    |  28,#2,42,2,96,128)
          sprites and then moves them   | >120 CALL JOYST(1,X1,Y1,2,X2,
          around according to the input |  Y2)
          from the joysticks.           | >130 CALL MOTION(#1,-Y1,X1,#2
          Two players with the same     |  -Y2,X2)
          input speed and motion.       | >140 GOTO 120

          response and more variables are used to control routines
          for a user.
