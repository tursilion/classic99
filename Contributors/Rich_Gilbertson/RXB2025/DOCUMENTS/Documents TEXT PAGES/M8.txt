          RAM may be moved but not into ROM, and that you may move 
          memory into GRAM but not GROM. You can copy or move memory 
          from ROM or GROM. Also note that any devices that use phony 
          GRAM will not work with MOVES as these devices don't use the

          Line 100 has the type$ string.| >100 X$="VV"
          Line 110 thus uses type$ 0 VDP| >110 CALL MOVES(X$,767,1,0)
          to VDP. 767 bytes are moved. A|
          VDP from-address of 1 and a   |
          VDP to-address of 0. Will use |
          a ripple effect of moving all |
          screen bytes over one address.|
