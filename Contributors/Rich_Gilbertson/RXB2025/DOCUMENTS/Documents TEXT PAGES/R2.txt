          Format         RES                      (Uses default values)
 
                         RES initial line,increment

          Description
 
          The RES command is the same as per Extended Basic Manual page
          155. The RESEQENCE command is deleted. The abbreviation RES is
          the only access name. The RES command now allows a portion of
          the program to be resequenced. This RES DOES NOT REPLACE any
          undefined line numbers with 32767. Any undefined line numbers
          in the program are left as is. This makes it easier to fix if
          a problem is present. RES cannot be used to move lines from 
          one location to another inside a program. If the new line 
          numbers generated by the RES command would result in a line
          being moved, a Bad Line Number Error is generated. A Bad Line 
          Number Error is also reported if there are no valid program 
          lines between start line and end line.
