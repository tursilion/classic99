          OFF (SAMS)     option for subprogram                 PAGE  O1
          -------------------------------------------------------------
 
          Format         CALL SAMS("OFF")
 
 
          Description
 
          SAMS("OFF") command will only work with a SAMS memory card. 
          The read/write lines to the AMS mapper registers are turned
          off so they will not be changed. Any PEEK or LOAD to the DSR
          space will be zero after the SAMS("OFF") command. They can't
          be read/written to. See docs MANUAL-AMS for examples of 
          memory maps. 
          Also run SAMS-TEST or SAMS-SAVE or SAMS-LOAD programs.
 
          Programs
 
          This turns on read/write.     | >100 CALL SAMS("ON")
          This fetches map register 2.  | >110 CALL PEEK(16388,BYTE)
          This turns off read/write.    | >120 CALL SAMS("OFF")
          This turns on pass mode.      | >130 CALL SAMS("PASS")
          This prints the page from map | >140 PRINT "Register 2 PAGE#"
           mode in register 2.          |  ;BYTE
                                        |

          The above program will print out initialized SAMS page 2 in 
          register 2. 
      
          It is recommended that CALL SAMS("OFF") only be used to 
          protect the AMS mapper registers from being molested by 
          programs that could access the AMS. CALL SAMS is more 
          easy to use to manage SAMS memory as SAMS always turns off 
          the SAMS read/write registers like SAMS("OFF") does.
